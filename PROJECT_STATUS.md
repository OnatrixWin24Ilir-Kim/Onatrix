## ‚ùå What's Missing

### Critical for G (Godk√§nt - Pass)

1. **Missing Pages** (Based on typical Figma design)

   - ‚ùå Services page (list of all services)
   - ‚ùå Service Details pages (individual service pages as child pages)
   - ‚ùå Projects/Portfolio page
   - ‚ùå Project Details pages (child pages)
   - ‚ùå Contact page
   - ‚ùå Possibly: Team page, Blog page

2. **Forms** (G requires visual, VG requires functional)

   - ‚ùå Contact form (needs to exist visually on Contact page)
   - ‚ùå Newsletter/callback forms in various sections

3. **Content Structure**
   - ‚ùå "Posters" (likely Service pages or Project pages) as child pages under relevant parent
   - ‚ùå For VG: List view for these child pages in backoffice

### Critical for VG (V√§l Godk√§nt - Pass with Distinction)

4. **Forms - Functional** (VG requirement)

   - ‚ùå Form validation (client-side and server-side)
   - ‚ùå Form submissions saved to backoffice (Umbraco Forms or custom implementation)
   - ‚ùå Email confirmation sent to user after submission
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to install Umbraco Forms package OR create custom form handling

5. **Responsive Design** (VG requirement)

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify: Is the CSS responsive? Check:
     - Mobile breakpoints
     - Tablet breakpoints
     - Desktop layouts
   - Current `/wwwroot/css/style.css` needs review

6. **List View for Child Pages** (VG requirement)

   - ‚ùå Services or Projects need ListView configured in backoffice
   - This is for better content management of "poster" child pages

7. **Git Branch Strategy** (VG requirement)

   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Current commits are all to main
   - VG requires: "Git anv√§nds p√• ett korrekt s√§tt, du arbetar i brancher och mergar till main f√∂rst n√§r en del √§r klar"
   - Need to work in feature branches going forward

8. **Azure Deployment** (Required for both G and VG)
   - ‚ùå Not deployed yet
   - ‚ùå Admin user needs to be created: `hans@onatrix.com` / `BytMig123!`
   - ‚ùå Database needs to be configured on Azure (currently SQLite for local dev)
